## Mission Statement

This is our personal collection of some important ideas in computer science and programming. It shall help us document high-level insights that can serve us in practice. We do not try to capture topics in-depth, but instead just try to make us aware, so that we know what to look for when we are in need.

We also try to document some of our occasional nuggets of temporary insights. 

## Main Topics
* Nothing substantial yet

## Sources to review
* Study notes
    - Compiler Construction 
    - Experimental Economics: Design Elements (e.g., basline neighborhood) and the basic idea of falsification as supplement material for the algorithm engineering notes
    - Formal Systems (something in there?)
    - Advanced Data Structures
    - Parallel Algorithms
    - Parallel Machines and Parallel Programming
    - Randomized Algorithms
    - Computerarchitecture (implications of branch predictions, cache coherece, pipelining, super scalar architecutures ...)
    - Softwareengineering II
    - Game Theory (Battle of the sexes :p) 
* Lecture notes and books to skim
    - Algorithm Engineering 
    - Algorithm II
    - Algorithms and Data Structures â€” The Basic Toolbox
    - Linder's _Things Thy Should have taught you_
* Books with potential:
    - Pragmatic Thinking and Learning
    - Notes from the Pragmatic Programmer
    - Notes from Head First Software Development (Very light stuff but maybe there is something in there. I used to enjoy reading it.)
    - ...
