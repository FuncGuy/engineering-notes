## Mission Statement

This is our personal collection of some important ideas in computer science and programming. It shall help us document high-level insights that can serve us in practice. We do not try to capture topics in-depth, but instead just try to make us aware, so that we know what to look for when we are in need. We are aware that when everything is important, nothing is important.

We also try to document some of our occasional nuggets of temporary insights.
