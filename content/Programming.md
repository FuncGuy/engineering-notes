# Programming

## Common Principles
* Think hard before you start. 
* Focus. Eliminate distractions and obstacles. If you cannot stay within _the flow_, you are doing something wrong.
* _Make it_, _make it run_ (so that the tests pass), _make it better_ (review and refactor until you can honestly say that it is good enough)
* If in doubt, leave it out (abstractions, features, ...), because _you ain't gonna need it (YAGNI)!_ You can always come back later. Don't waste your time now.

## Object-oriented Programming
* Using an OO-language does not imply you _'got it'_ and are doing it right.
* If nothing else, do atleast try to follow the _tell, don't ask_ principle. 

## Testing
* Look for _inflection points_ as the sweet spot between testing effort and covered functionality.

## Debugging
* Again, think before you start. Relax, breath and fetch your favorite beverage. Find the bug in your head. Only then start the debugger, if at all!
* Debugging is not a reason to stay overtime. Document your thought process so that you know where to pick up the next day.
* If stuck, describe your problem to an (imaginary) colleague. 
* Dig until you have found the root cause. If you are inclined to just add a `null` check, you haven't found it yet.
