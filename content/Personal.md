# Personal Development

* Always life on the edge of incompetence. When ever you have the chance, approach challenges beyond your current skill level. Be focused, determined and passioned and you will be fine, because even if you fail (what you won't), you have learned a great deal.
* Invest your time in activities with the highest learning rate. Learning follows an exponential growth curve. Knowledge gives you a foundation, enabling you to gain more knowledge even faster. Just like with compound interest, even a small delta in learning rate will have a huge difference in the long run.
* Never presume to already know. Have a beginner's mind.
* _"Money is nothing more than neutral proof that you're adding value to people's lives. Making sure you're making money is just a way of making sure you're doing something of value to others."_ -- [Derek Sivers][sivers2008berklee]
* We judge others by their _actions_, but judge ourselves only by our _intentions_ (even if the result sucked hard). Don't.
* Important work is rarely (if ever) glamorous while it is being done. The glamour comes much later - if at all.

## Thinking

* Two of the most important executive functions are _cognitive flexibility_ and _cognitive self-control_. Cognitive flexibility is the ability to see alternative solutions to problems, to think outside the box, to negotiate unfamiliar situations. Cognitive self-control is the ability to inhibit an instinctive or habitual response and substitute a more effective, less obvious one. [howtothink]. You need both


## Studying

* Nobody will teach you anything. You have to teach yourself.
* Studying is not about time, it's about effort. You have to approach a difficult topics from different angles and discuss it with peers. Make the ideas your own by discovering them for yourself (e.g., with your own examples). Stupid repetition just does not cut it. If you have to memorize something, you haven't understood it.
* Don't miss the big picture by getting lost in all the details. Always zoom-out again and fish for connections and insights.
* Always write down key insights as succinctly and precisely as possible. Feel the pain. You have to do it, because it is a different thing to believe to understand something and to be able to articulate it.
* If stuck with anything, ask yourself _what exactly_ is it, that you don't understand?
* It's uncomfortable to focus so intensely on what you’re bad at.  If you really want to get better at something, you have to figure out what you’re doing wrong. [howtothink]


## Teaching

* Challenge the student by constantly asking questions. Let the student prove they got it. Set a high pace.


## Stress & Burnout Prehab

* Stress kills creativity and gives you a bad hangover. Don't get back to work just because you are bored. Once your creativity returns (with ideas on cool projects, the strong desire to read one the countless unread books on your shelf, ...) you will feel more energetic than ever and can re-approach your life (and work) with a whole new mind.
* Focus is like mana: It can be empty and recharges slowly.


## Inter-personal

* Encourage people to shine, even if this implies they might move on and leave you behind. Don't be afraid to loose them.
* Your candle does not burn brighter if you try to diminish theirs.
