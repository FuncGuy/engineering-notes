# Personal Development

* Always life on the edge of incompetence. When ever you have the chance, approach challanges beyond your current skill level. Be focused, determined and passioned and you will be invincible, because even if you fail (what you won't), you have learned a great deal.
* There is no speed limit in life. You don't have to move (improve, learn, ...) as slowly and overcautiously as others. 
* Never presume to already know. Have a beginner's mind.
* Awareness trumps trying.
* Act or accept there is nothing in between. 
* "Money is nothing more than neutral proof that you're adding value to people's lives. Making sure you're making money is just a way of making sure you're doing something of value to others." (Derek Sivers)

## Studying
* Approach study tasks like you approach programming taks (see the common principles)
* Do not expect teachers to teach you (they only present information). Nobody will teach you anything. You have to teach yourself.
* Studying is not about time, it's about effort. You have to approach a difficult topics from different angles and discuss it with peers. Make the ideas your own by discovering them for yourself (e.g., with your own examples). Stupid repetition just does not cut it. If you have to memorize something, you haven't understood it.
* Don't miss the big picture by getting lost in all the details. Always zoom-out again and fish for connections and insights.
* Always write down key insights as succinctly and precicely as possible. Feel the pain. You have to do it, because it is a different thing to believe to understand something and to be able to articulate it.
* If stuck with anything, ask yourself _what exactly__ is it, that you don't understand? (See the notes on debugging).



## Stress & Burnout Prehab
* Stress kills creativity and gives you a bad hangover. Don't get back to work just because you are bored. Once your creativity returns (with ideas on cool projects, the strong desire to read one the countless unread books on your shelf, people you really want to meet again, ...) you will feel more energetic than ever and can re-approach your life (and work) with a whole new mind.

## Mentoring & Teaching
* Challenge the student by constantly asking questions. Let the student prove they got it. Set a high pace.
