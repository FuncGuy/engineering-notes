# Desigining Abstractions

* Single Level of Abstraction
* Single Responsibility Principle
* Separation of Concerns
* Interface Segragation Principle
* Liskov Substitution Principle
* Open Closed Principle
* Law of Demeter

If I am not totally mistaken, these principles are well described within SICP.
