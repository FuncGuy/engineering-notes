# Desigining Abstractions

* Single Level of Abstraction
* Single Responsibility principle
    - as of Markus Klein: 'know just one thing'
    - as of Robert C. Martin: 'one reason to change'
* Separation of Concerns
* Interface Segragation Principle
    - NVI (Non-Virtual-Interface) is somewhat also interface segragation. We separate the implementation from the usage side of the interface.
* Liskov Substitution Principle
* Open Closed Principle
* Law of Demeter

If I am not totally mistaken, these principles are well described within SICP.
